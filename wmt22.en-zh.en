Libya: plan for presidential election on 24 December close to collapse
The chances of Libya staging its first presidential elections on the long planned date of 24 December appeared close to collapse on Sunday after the body overseeing the vote said it was unable to announce the the approved candidates because of continued legal doubts.
With the elections less than a fortnight away and virtually no time for campaigning, a postponement would represent a bitter blow to the international community's hopes of reuniting the deeply divided country.
Foreign powers will also fear the overall momentum towards democracy could dissipate.
In the short term they will have to agree whether or not the interim government continues in order to fill the political vacuum and prevent a return to civil war.
A series of court rulings have overturned the Libyan electoral commission's decisions to block high-profile figures including Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the former dictator, from standing for the presidency.
The interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and warlord Khalifa Haftar, the head of the self-styled Libyan National Army, have meanwhile been approved by the commission but subsequently appealed by other parties.
It said in a statement on Saturday it said could not announce the names of the approved candidates out of the nearly who 100 have applied because it was "keen to exhaust all means of litigation to ensure its decisions comply with issued judgements."
Rival factions have accused each other of intimidating or bribing judicial officials to secure their reinstatement of their candidates, and the commission is looking to see if the decisions were valid.
In the case of Dbeibah, he had pledged as a condition of becoming interim PM that he would not stand for election but has since argued in court that this was a moral pledge with no legal force.
Saif Gaddafi was convicted in absentia in 2015 on war crimes charges for his part in fighting the revolution that toppled his father, Muammar Gaddafi.
He denies wrongdoing.
The presence of tens of thousands of foreign fighters, mercenaries and indigenous militia make the country a tinderbox, and there are fears an election conducted with disputed candidates would only lead to a result that was not recognized.
In a sign of the tensions over foreign forces, France is pressing the EU to agree on Monday to impose sanctions on the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group, which it says operates in Libya and the Sahel.
Moscow denies Wagner is linked to the Russian state and has said it would retaliate against EU sanctions placed on its citizens.
The international community's ability to demand the Libyan political class stick to the 24 December election date, which was first agreed in February, has been hampered by the appointment of a UN special envoy, Ján Kubiš, who resigned three weeks before the elections after less than a year in the post.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has since appointed Stephanie Williams, a forceful former UN deputy special envoy, to act as his special adviser.
Russia vetoed her appointment as a full envoy, but she has deep knowledge of Libya and last year displayed a willingness to confront those in the political class opposed to elections.
The UN mission issued a statement urging all sides not to reverse the gains made, pointing to the registration of nearly 3 million voters, the successful distribution of voter cards and the applications of large numbers of candidates for the presidency and parliament as signs of deep popular support for elections.
The US ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, said "refusing to go to the elections and mobilizing to obstruct will only place the fate and future of the country at the mercy of those inside Libya and their external backers who prefer bullet power over ballot power."
Android hardware Cleaning tip
Thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm) DRY interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house your smart device microphones and speakers.
They are a cheap product and safer than many other methods, such as rubbing alcohols, tooth picks, pins, and needles.
I just used this method to clear the microphone port on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as it was not registering my voice when using speech to text functions.
After months of thinking, I would need to arrange a warranty replacement or need to book a repair.
After much frustration shouting at my watch during phone calls so I could be heard and/or understood.
After following manufacturer advice and using the water lock functions, resetting the device AND factory restoring my device.
And after scouring the internet on multiple occasions.
There seemed to be no guaranteed satisfaction.
Then I had a revelation and I tried interdental brushes, and they work...
They work very VERY well!
After a few pokes and twizzles with the thin but firm bristled rod, your device should work just as it did when it was brand new.
*I advise this be done with a dry brush, and will not accept any repercussion if you decide to use it with any combination of any cleaning product.
South Africa Pays Tribute to Last Apartheid Leader De Klerk
South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy.
De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer.
Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor.
He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa's transition from white-minority rule to the first multi-racial elections in 1994.
De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990.
Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election.
President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk's honor.
"He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness," De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees.
I shall never forget this man who mesmerized me, who made me want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him.
A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers.
Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions.
Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer.
De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority.
Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police.
The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security.
Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk's image amid criticism for his failure to apologize officially for the crimes of apartheid.
In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing.
De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing "for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage that apartheid has done" to South Africa's non-white populations.

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5
An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others.
The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss.
The identity of the man who died hasn't been released, but authorities say he wasn't breathing after being pulled out of the snow and didn't survive despite CPR efforts by another skier.
The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow.
All were wearing avalanche beacons.
While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort.
The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.
Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion.
"Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest.
They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds (of the resort) where this slide occurred," DeBerry said
In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour).
The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall.
The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters).
"We've had a late start to the season and now we've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm.
People got excited," DeBerry said.
"We all have to remember that it's a sport that carries risk."
Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in Washington state, encompassing 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares).
